##Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

Tailwind CSS Guidelines
Version Requirements
ALWAYS use Tailwind CSS v3.4.x - DO NOT use Tailwind CSS v4 until explicitly instructed.

Initial Setup Verification
After running create-next-app, immediately verify the Tailwind version:

Check package.json for "tailwindcss": "^3.4.x"
If v4 is installed, immediately downgrade:
npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss tw-animate-css
npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss autoprefixer
Required Configuration Files
1. tailwind.config.ts (MUST exist):

import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: "2rem",
      screens: {
        "2xl": "1400px",
      },
    },
    extend: {
      // Custom theme extensions here
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
export default config;
2. postcss.config.mjs (standard v3 format):

const config = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};

export default config;
3. globals.css (v3 syntax):

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  /* Base styles here */
}

@layer components {
  /* Reusable component styles using @apply */
}
Tailwind v3 vs v4 Detection
Signs you're accidentally using v4:

❌ No tailwind.config.ts file exists
❌ globals.css uses @import "tailwindcss"
❌ globals.css has @theme inline blocks
❌ postcss.config.mjs uses "@tailwindcss/postcss" plugin
❌ Colors defined with oklch() values
Correct v3 setup:

✅ tailwind.config.ts exists with content array
✅ globals.css uses @tailwind base/components/utilities
✅ postcss.config.mjs uses tailwindcss and autoprefixer
✅ CSS variables use HSL format: hsl(var(--color-name))
shadcn/ui Compatibility
When using shadcn/ui with Tailwind v3:

Ensure components.json specifies Tailwind v3 compatibility
If shadcn detects v4, reject the setup and reinstall Tailwind v3 first
Use legacy shadcn docs at v3.shadcn.com if needed
Global CSS File Usage
When working with Tailwind, most styling should stay in the component (.tsx files) using utility classes. The global CSS file should only be used for the following categories:

1. Base & Reset Styles
Normalize or override browser defaults for body, h1–h6, p, ul, ol, etc.
Apply consistent line-heights and spacing across the app.
2. Typography Setup
Define global font families, font weights, and base font sizes.
Ensure headings and body text use our brand typeface.
3. Brand Identity Tokens
Colors, spacing, and breakpoints live in tailwind.config.js.
Only reference them in CSS if absolutely necessary.
4. Global Page Styles
Default body background color and text color.
Scrollbar, selection color, or global transitions if required.
5. Reusable Patterns via @apply
Components like .btn-primary, .input, .card when utility classes would otherwise be repeated excessively.
Keep these minimal and scoped.
6. Third-Party / Utility Styles
External fonts, animation keyframes, or imported libraries.
Print styles and accessibility tweaks (e.g. focus outlines).
Rule of Thumb
Local, one-off styles → keep them inline in .tsx.
Global, shared, or brand-defining styles → put them in globals.css.
